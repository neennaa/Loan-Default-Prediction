# Loan-Default-Prediction
 Machine learning model to predict loan defaults based on borrower data.
# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan applicant will default based on historical loan and borrower data.

## 📂 Contents
- `loan_default_data.csv`: Dataset with borrower and loan details
- `loan_default_model.ipynb`: Notebook with data cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, and prediction models

## 🔍 Features in the Dataset
- Age, Income, Credit Score
- Employment Length, Loan Amount
- Loan Purpose, Default status, etc.

## 🧠 ML Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree / Random Forest
- XGBoost (optional)
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC Curve

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Project Outcome
We build a model that helps predict potential defaulters, which is useful for banks and lending institutions to reduce risk.
